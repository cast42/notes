# Notes

This is my personal notes repo.

## Structure

- `inbox/` — agent + human scratchpad (daily capture)
- `topics/` — evergreen topic notes (including subfolders)
  - `topics/coaching/`
  - `topics/learning/`
  - `topics/rag.md`, `topics/embeddings.md`, `topics/duckdb.md`
- `meetings/` — dated meeting notes
- `refs/` — reference material (papers, links)
- `_meta/` — tags, glossary, conventions

## Conventions

- Use ISO dates: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Prefer short sections + bullets
- Capture first, organize later
