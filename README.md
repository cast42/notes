# Notes

This is my personal notes folder.

## Structure

- `coaching/` — coaching notes, sessions, frameworks, experiments
- `learning/` — what I’m learning, summaries, experiments, questions

## Conventions

- Use ISO dates for dated notes: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Prefer short, scannable sections.
- Keep an `inbox.md` per area for quick capture.
