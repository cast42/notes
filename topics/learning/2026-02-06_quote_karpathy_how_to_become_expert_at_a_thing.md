# How to become expert at a thing (Karpathy)

## TL;DR
A simple learning loop: **do real projects**, **learn on demand**, **teach what you learn**, and **measure progress against yourself**.

## Takeaways
- Projects pull learning forward; “study-first” often stalls.
- Summarizing/teaching is a forcing function for understanding.
- The only comparison that matters is *you vs. you*.

## Details (verbatim)
1. Iteratively take on concrete projects and accomplish them depth wise, learning “on demand” (i.e. don’t learn bottom up breadth wise).
2. Teach/summarize everything you learn in your own words.
3. Only compare yourself to younger you, never to others.
