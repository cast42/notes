# The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn (Hamming)

## TL;DR
Hamming’s book isn’t a conventional technical text—it’s a reflection on how strong scientists/engineers **think, learn, and choose problems**, with a bias toward doing **significant** work (not just competent work).

## Takeaways
- “Learning to learn” isn’t just study tactics; it’s also about **taste**, **problem selection**, and **habits of mind**.
- Useful to revisit periodically, especially when you feel busy-but-not-impactful.

## Details
- First published: **1997** (based on lectures at the Naval Postgraduate School).
- Context: Hamming worked at Bell Labs; contributed to computer science, information theory, and numerical methods.
- Positioning: a “meta” book—how to aim your career/attention toward meaningful contributions.
