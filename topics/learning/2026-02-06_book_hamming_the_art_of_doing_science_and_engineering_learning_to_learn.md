# The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn (Hamming)

## TL;DR
Hamming’s book isn’t a conventional technical text—it’s a reflection on how strong scientists/engineers **think, learn, and choose problems**, with a bias toward doing **significant** work (not just competent work).

## Takeaways
- **Meta-learning**: understanding how you learn and think can compound more than any single topic.
- **Great vs. average**: great scientists deliberately choose **important problems** and create time to work on them.
- **Creativity needs preparation**: deep familiarity enables insights (“chance favors the prepared mind”).
- **Interdisciplinary edges matter**: many breakthroughs happen at intersections of fields.
- **Communication is a force multiplier**: writing/teaching/persuasion are core skills, not garnish.
- **Important work requires intent**: if you don’t work on important problems, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work.
- **Ethics/responsibility**: knowledge → power → responsibility.

## Details
### Key ideas (from your notes)
1. **Learning to learn**
   - Hamming emphasizes meta-learning: understanding how you learn and think is more valuable than any single subject.
2. **Great vs. average scientists**
   - Great scientists ask: *What are the most important problems in my field?* and make time to work on them.
   - They cultivate curiosity, persistence, and critical thinking.
3. **Creativity and preparation**
   - Creativity comes from deep familiarity with the field, without being imprisoned by it.
   - “Chance favors the prepared mind” (Pasteur).
4. **Interdisciplinary thinking**
   - Crossing boundaries (physics/math/biology/engineering) pays.
   - Breakthroughs often come from intersections.
5. **Communication and influence**
   - Great work needs clear communication; writing/teaching/persuasion matter.
6. **Work and motivation**
   - “If you do not work on important problems, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work.”
   - Choose problems deliberately; manage time; build environments that foster creativity.
7. **Ethics and responsibility**
   - Consider impact; power implies responsibility.

### Quick context
- First published: **1997** (based on lectures at the Naval Postgraduate School).
- Hamming worked at Bell Labs; contributed to computer science, information theory, and numerical methods.
