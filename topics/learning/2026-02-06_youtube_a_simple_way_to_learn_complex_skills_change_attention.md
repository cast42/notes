# A Simple Way to Learn Complex Skills — change what you pay attention to

## TL;DR
A learning heuristic: skill acquisition often hinges on **noticing the right signals**. If you change what you pay attention to during practice, you can compress the feedback loop and learn faster.

## Takeaways
- If you’re stuck, don’t only do “more reps”—change the **focus variable** you track.
- Learning accelerates when you can:
  - identify a *key constraint* (the one thing that most improves performance)
  - get fast feedback
  - iterate deliberately

## Details
I couldn’t reliably extract a transcript from the YouTube page via `web_fetch` (it only returned the shell), so this note is intentionally light and keeps the link as a reminder.

If you want, I can pull the transcript via a dedicated transcript tool (or browser relay) and expand this note with concrete examples.
