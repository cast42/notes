# Writes and Write-Nots

## TL;DR
Paul Graham argues that AI will remove the day-to-day pressure to learn to write, creating a split between people who **can write** and those who effectively **can’t** (because they always outsource writing).
The problem: **writing is a form of thinking**—so this becomes a split between people who can think clearly and those who only *feel* like they are.

## Takeaways
- Writing well is hard because **thinking clearly is hard**.
- Many prestigious jobs require writing; historically, this forced most people to become at least “okay” writers.
- AI is an escape valve: people can avoid learning to write.
- The “middle” may disappear: instead of good/ok/bad writers, we get **writers vs. write-nots**.
- The real risk is cognitive: a world of **thinks vs. think-nots**.
- Like physical strength in modern life, writing/thinking becomes an intentional practice you choose.

## Details (useful quote)
> If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.

Context: Graham is quoting Leslie Lamport to make the point that some thinking is only possible through writing.
