# How to learn (Hamel Husain)

Source: https://hamel.dev/notes/how-to-learn/

## Highlights / notes

### Focused vs Diffused mode

- You can’t access focused and diffused mode simultaneously.
- Diffuse mode can be accessed via walks/exercise; capture notes quickly because insights evaporate.
- A classic trick: fall-asleep / wake-up threshold (e.g., Salvador Dali holding keys).

### Procrastination, memory, sleep

- Pomodoro technique as a way to combat procrastination.
- Periodic relaxation (~30 minutes) helps access diffuse mode (“let the mortar dry”).
- Spaced repetition (e.g. Anki) builds memory.
- Review what you want to learn right before sleep; can increase chances of dreaming / making connections.
- Exercise can help create/sustain new neurons in the hippocampus.

### Writing + diffuse mode

- Writing ideas = diffuse; editing = focused.
- Suggestions:
  - Mind map instead of outlining.
  - Don’t edit while drafting.
  - Tools like https://writeordie.com can force drafting.

### Chunking

- Best chunks become subconscious (“tying your shoes”).
- You build chunks by practicing, not observing.
- Skim a chapter first (headings, pictures) to help chunking.

### Illusions of competence

- After reading, look away and recall what you remember (or draw a concept map).
- Recall beats rereading; rereading can help when spaced.
- Recall in different locations to avoid context cues.

### Deliberate practice

- Focus on the difficult bits.
- Interleave topics.

### Juggling life and learning

- Write tomorrow’s todo list the night before (frees working memory; gives subconscious time).
- Plan quitting time.

### Ultralearning (from the book)

- Metalearning: map the domain.
- Project-based learning + drills on weaknesses.
- Cold retrieval is best (“rewrite notebook from memory”).
- Fast feedback.
- Build intuition via your own examples/visualization.
- Explain it simply (Feynman).
- Copy → Create.
- Explore extremes; choose difficult projects.

## TODO

- [ ] Pull 3 practices from this and try for 2 weeks (pomodoro + spaced repetition + pre-sleep review?).
