# Thought for the weekend: A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept (John Ousterhout)

## TL;DR
A small sustained improvement rate (**slope**) beats a big initial advantage (**y‑intercept**) over time.
The practical takeaway: optimize for habits and systems that keep you improving, not for impressive starting conditions.

## Takeaways
- **Slope > intercept**: initial talent/resources matter, but the improvement rate dominates long horizons.
- If you want better outcomes, focus on:
  - consistent practice
  - feedback loops
  - eliminating friction that kills momentum
  - doing small “boring” reps that accumulate
- This is motivational *because it’s actionable*: you can usually change slope more than intercept.

## Details
The key visual is two lines:
- one starts higher (better y‑intercept) but has a lower slope
- the other starts lower but has a higher slope
- eventually they **intersect**; after that, the higher-slope trajectory dominates
