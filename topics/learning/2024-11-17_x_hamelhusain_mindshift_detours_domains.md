# Detours across domains (Hamel Husain) + Mindshift (Barbara Oakley)

## TL;DR
It’s normal (and valuable) to take “detours” across domains (law, writing, marketing, etc.). Oakley’s *Mindshift* is a supportive frame for switching/expanding skill domains without guilt.

## Takeaways
- “Detours” can be an asset: they build a broader toolkit and better cross-domain pattern matching.
- The guilt often comes from a linear-career myth; in practice, many strong builders bounce between domains.
- A good anchor: pick a domain to push forward right now, but keep optionality for periodic domain exploration.

## Details
Hamel mentions feeling guilty about bouncing across domains until being introduced (by Jeremy Howard) to Barbara Oakley’s book:
