# Steve Jobs — how to design insanely great products

*Big Brain Business — @BigBrainBizness*

## TL;DR

- UX-first, obsess over details, ruthless focus (say no), iterate with real prototypes, and integrate the whole stack.

## Highlights

- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- Start with the user experience, then work backwards to the technology
- Say no to 1,000 things
