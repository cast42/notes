# ‘Year of the personal agent’ — @steipete at YC (via Kyriakos Eleftheriou)

## TL;DR
A short set of takeaways from @steipete speaking at Y Combinator: software shifts toward **agent-first** consumption.

## Takeaways (from the post)
- “All apps will become APIs or disappear”
- Apps that remain will be **games** or **sensor-heavy**
- Your **agent**, not you, will be the primary consumer of software
- Personal AI agents will quietly take over daily workflows
- “We are possibly in the year of the personal agent”
