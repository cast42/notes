## TL;DR

A curated, categorized index of **~1700+ community OpenClaw skills** sourced from **ClawHub**, intended to make discovery easier (and filter out obvious spam/duplicates/risky categories). Useful as a browsing starting point before installing skills.

## What it is

Repo: https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills

- “Awesome list” style directory of OpenClaw skills.
- Sourced from **ClawHub** (OpenClaw’s public skills registry).
- Organized by category (Web/Frontend, Git/GitHub, DevOps, Browser automation, Notes/PKM, etc.).
- The README explains this is a *subset* chosen from a bigger registry by filtering out:
  - crypto/blockchain/DeFi
  - spam/bulk-generated content
  - duplicates
  - non‑English descriptions
  - and (best effort) risky/harmful skills

## How to use it (practically)

- Use it to **discover** skill slugs and jump to the canonical `github.com/openclaw/skills/.../SKILL.md` entries.
- Treat inclusion as **not a security guarantee**—still skim the `SKILL.md`, and be wary of skills that run scripts or touch credentials.

## Install pointers (from repo)

- Install via ClawHub CLI (per README):
  - `npx clawhub@latest install <skill-slug>`
- Or copy skill folders into:
  - `~/.openclaw/skills/` (global)
  - `<project>/skills/` (workspace)
