# QMD-based memory built into OpenClaw (tobi)

## TL;DR
Tobi points out that OpenClaw has **QMD-based memory built in**, tying back to the OpenClaw 2026.2.2 release notes that mention an **opt-in QMD backend** for workspace memory.

## Takeaways
- QMD isn’t only a standalone tool/skill; it also shows up as a **first-class memory backend** option in OpenClaw.
- This strengthens the “local-first notes + hybrid search” workflow for agent memory.
