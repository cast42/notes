# Pi — the AI harness that powers OpenClaw (Armin Ronacher & Mario Zechner)

## TL;DR
A video discussion about **Pi**, described as “the AI harness that powers OpenClaw”.
I’m interested because:
- **Armin Ronacher** is the creator of **Flask**
- **Pi** is the agent/harness used in OpenClaw, so understanding it helps understand how OpenClaw “just runs code” in practice.

## Takeaways (initial)
- Pi is framed as a *harness* (i.e. the scaffolding around models/tools) rather than “just a model choice”.
- The conversation is likely to cover: tool execution, environments, memory/context handling, and how to keep an agent reliable.

## Details

### Transcript (TODO)
I installed the `youtube-full` agent skill (TranscriptAPI-backed) so we can pull a clean transcript and expand this note with:
- key ideas + architecture points
- quotes with timestamps
- actionable takeaways for using/extending Pi inside OpenClaw

Pending: TranscriptAPI key setup (`TRANSCRIPT_API_KEY`).
