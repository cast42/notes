## Transcript (from longcut.ai)

I took over a team in the technology organization and it was considered the worst performing team in the whole organization and I thought oh my god what am I going to do with this team it's all going to be really bad and it's a career ending situation and when I spoke to them they were all super interesting thoughtful kind and really smart interesting wonderful people and I realized it's not them it's how they were set up how they were led the core set of process of culture that they were pushed into, they couldn't win.

>> I think we found this in organizations when we've interviewed them. If you talk to people in the organization, they have the answers. They know what's wrong. the answers. They know what's wrong. They know what to do. They know what's not working. And it's creating that that not working. And it's creating that that culture of trust. So, I I do find it fascinating. I am a technologist. I'm an fascinating. I am a technologist. I'm an engineer, but I'm actually more reliant now on psychology. How do you bring people along? How do you trust them? How people along? How do you trust them? How do you create an environment of trust where they can safely test things, grow their confidence, feel like they're actually making a difference?

>> Leading and scaling a business isn't hard because you lack ideas. It's hard because your time, your team's time, and your focus get eaten alive by the daily grind. Too many leaders are overwhelmed, grind. Too many leaders are overwhelmed, under pressure, and bogged down by lowlever tasks. I've learned this the lowlever tasks. I've learned this the hard way. Scaling nobody studios, hard way. Scaling nobody studios, advising fast growing startups and Fortune 500s, all while leading multiple ventures at once. I've seen firsthand how even the best executives get buried in meetings, lose strategic visibility, and burn out just trying to keep up. That's why I built the AI executive coaching program. The same frameworks coaching program. The same frameworks and tools that I've used in my own work to make it more meaningful, better leveraged, and more impactful. We're helping leaders in global businesses get hours back every week, turning chaos into clarity and operating with more leverage than ever before. This isn't theory. This is about identifying the traits you need to unlearn. The tasks pivotal to your success and the tools that can be built into workflows to optimize your capabilities every day. From transforming meeting scripts into transcripts into action plans and spotting performance patterns you can't see on your own, we're upgrading the way executive lead. If you want to scale executive lead. If you want to scale without losing your edge, let's talk. You'd be surprised how quickly you can lead at a whole new level.

I first met Jana Werner while collaborating on a case study at Tesco's Bank during one of the most turbulent times for organizations around the world. Together we explored how crisis world. Together we explored how crisis could accelerate transformation. How uncertainty could spark innovation, agility, and resilience when leaders chose to act rather than wait. These lessons from that experience were later published in our article, Accelerating Transformation in Crisis. and we've stayed in touch ever since. Jana's ability to translate complexity into clarity and lead with both precision and empathy is nothing short of remarkable.

So when I learned that Jana had joined Amazon Web Services and was teaming up with Phil Le Brun who was previously at McDonald's, another client and another leader I knew to be deeply versed in helping organizations evolve at scale to write the Octopus organization. I wasinstantly intrigued.

This book captures a vision that feels urgent for our time. How organizations can thrive in an age of continuous transformation and be more adaptive, fluid, and purpose- driven. Much like an octopus itself.

Yan and Phil don't just describe a new model, they live it. Through their own work at Tesco's, McDonald's, and the hundreds of business leaders they work with and have spoken to as they created this book, they've shown how balancing intelligence and instinct, autonomy and alignment, systems and soul, the octopus organization is their invitation to rethink what it means to lead, learn, and evolve in a world that never stops changing.

I couldn't be happier to changing. I couldn't be happier to welcome them both to celebrate the book's release and they continue their journey together exploring how leaders all over the world are innovating in today's times.

So let's get started. today's times. So let's get started.

>> I worked in a Tesco bank in a bank. I took over I did a lot of work there in different parts of the organization and eventually I took over a team in the technology organization and that team felt really demotivated. It was considered the worst performing team in the whole organization. I took them over. I spoke to each one of them what's over. I spoke to each one of them what's going on, what they're doing. And I had these preconceptions and worries that they may be lazy or incapable. And I thought, "Oh my god, what am I going to do with this team? It's all going to be really bad and it's a career ending situation." And when I spoke to them, situation." And when I spoke to them, they were all super interesting, thoughtful, kind, and really smart, interesting, wonderful people. And I realized it's not them. It's how they were set up, how they were led, the core set of process of culture that they were pushed into. They couldn't win.

And so pushed into. They couldn't win. And so we started working differently. I started to be build a a culture of trust, thinking about outcomes, letting them lose to say come on go, just go and do, you don't have to ask me. Um, you are amazing people. And uh long story short, this team turned into the top performing team and was given all the firefighting and trauma cases. You know what happens in big organizations, something goes wrong, this team is the safe team. Go and fix it. And I was so safe team. Go and fix it. And I was so proud and it went from super bad to super great.

And this made me think this super great. And this made me think this isn't the people, it's the organization. How we set them up to either succeed or to fail. like parents, how do we boost to fail. like parents, how do we boost them to become a strong people that can live up to their best or not? And and that was for me a turning point of how I wanted to operate and how I wanted to unshackle the entire organization so that everybody, not just my team, could work like that.

>> Well, first of all, I just I love hearing that story. It sort of uh reminds me almost of the famous Numei story where GM had these factories that were you know sort of the worst performing factories and it was really just great people in a bad environment and >> you know also knowing you and meeting you around that time getting to share and writing a case study around your own experience was awesome. So I really would encourage folks to check that out.

Um, and I can and again it's amazing to see how you've continued to take those ideas and now have brought them forward into this new fantastic book, The Octopus Organization with Phil. So, Phil, what about you? Tell us some of your own uh sort of experiences that sort of led you to to where you are now today.

>> It's really interesting listening to Jana's story because my story is very similar. Different industry, different similar. Different industry, different issues. Felt more like a psychologist issues. Felt more like a psychologist than a technologist by the end of my time at McDonald's.

They joinedMcDonald's corporation. We had more technology stacks than we had countries. Everyone built their own stuff. It felt like they had control in each of the local markets. And there had been local markets. And there had been multiple failed attempts to find that balance between what do you centralize for efficiency and economy as a skill? What do you decentralize for for agility?

And there was a lot of that us agility? And there was a lot of that us and them going on in the organization. The corporate folks don't understand. The business units don't understand.

You know, simple acts. You talked about creating a cultural trust. Same thing, you know, bringing people together. So, it wasn't corporate didn't understand, but hey, maybe I haven't explained to John in the UK very well about what's happening.

So, we started really small. happening. So, we started really small. We brought a small cross functional team from some of the McDonald's markets and from corporate together and we did something silly. We just built a a something silly. We just built a a Windows operating system for our point of sale. Nothing exciting, but everyone of sale. Nothing exciting, but everyone had done that themselves.

So, we built one globally and it's it sort of worked. And then we built a data movement solution and a systems management solution, a point of sale solution, and then an e-commerce solution.

And it all came down to bringing people together, trusting them.

And I think we found this trusting them. And I think we found this in organizations when we've interviewed them. If you talk to people in the them. If you talk to people in the organization, they have the answers. They know what's wrong. They know what to do. They know what's not working.

And to do. They know what's not working. And it's creating that that culture of trust.

So I I do find it fascinating. I trust. So I I do find it fascinating. I am a technologist. I'm an engineer, but I am actually more reliant now on psychology. How do you bring people psychology. How do you bring people along? How do you trust them? How do you along? How do you trust them? How do you create an environment of trust where they can safely test things, grow their confidence, feel like they're actually making a difference?

And you when I by the time I left McDonald's, we' added tens of billions of dollars to the topline sale simply by bringing people together and unifying them against a common mission.

>> I really love what you're both sort of sharing about your stories. this notion that the people have the answers if you can really just create a system that allows them to be heard and for their ideas to be implemented.

You know, I think a lot of the best ideas generally come from people that are closest to the work rather than people who are layers above and further away or have have notions about what they think sort of should be happening to change these businesses.

And again, you've been both businesses. And again, you've been both part of some of the biggest businesses you can imagine in the world and and seeing that happen.

So for you Phil then what do you feel are maybe some of the things especially as you were speaking to so many people you know as you were writing the book like one of the things I thought was great that you you both did was you really went out and were speaking to so many people about their experiences which again is this common thread uh that you've obviously done through your careers.

So what were some of the things that you personally had to if you will unlearn when you were starting to think about the ideas you wanted to share uh in the octopus organization?

>> We were extremely lucky on this journey. We we spoke to some unbelievable people folks like Indra Nui the former CEO and chairperson of PepsiCo who's an Amazon board member now. Benadito Vner the CEO of Ferrari.

The thing that really blewof Ferrari. The thing that really blew us away is if you bumped into these people in the streets, you'd never know they were CEOs. Very humble, very driven, very smart, emotionally intelligent, smart.

And I think one of intelligent, smart. And I think one of the things it reinforced with me is this isn't about a leader who's transformed three industries and has come in and save a company. It's really about a leader who wants to learn.

We heard these stories like Indra spent time on the road with truck drivers and in restaurants really understanding what was happening at the front line and to set a vision which wasn't just one of these we're going to be a platform based machine learning enabled company that leverages our corporate synergies. You know these mission statements which mean absolutely nothing to anyone um but just very very simple mission statements which last a decade which everyone knows.

It's one of the things that we knows. It's one of the things that we find in Amazon is everyone knows our purpose is to be earth's most customer- ccentric company. Um so really on the ccentric company. Um so really on the surface very very simple things but it was the emotional intelligence piece which being brought up as an engineer we pride ourselves on having no emotional intelligence to start with and then developing that over time.

But that was way way more important. So, it was unlearning the fact I didn't need all of the answers.

That the people uh I the answers. That the people uh I recruited, the people who I worked with, they're actually incredibly smart. They've if you give them an environment where they can thrive, if you give them clear direction about a business outcome, you want to achieve and then you allow them to go after that and you as a leader are there to clear dependencies to help them think through things. You're not there to give things. You're not there to give answers.

That was really hard because answers. That was really hard because one of the uh the facts one of some of the facts we learned about children for instance I think I'm right in saying when you're about five or six years old you ask about 107 questions up to 107 questions an hour >> an hour every parent knows the why why it feels like more than 100 an hour >> and then as a as a teenager if they're still speaking to you what's how many >> I think around 10 or so and then as an adult it's like about two questions an hour.

So basically, we're trained to hour. So basically, we're trained to stop asking questions, to stop wanting to know, >> which is nuts because the more senior you are, the further away you are from the the front line, the less you actually know about the opportunities.

And it's it's one of the the things we learned from Indra was two characteristics she looks for in leaders is the ability to storytell and communicate. Still, one of the most communicate. Still, one of the most powerful things you can do to get people aligned, but secondly is curiosity. if you stop learning you you can no longer lead an organization.

So that was really invigorating. I ended up going back to invigorating. I ended up going back to school multiple times because there was this this unleashed desire to be more and more curious about what the opportunities were versus trying to get all of the answers.

>> Yeah, this is a great example. You also remind me of another guest we had on the show, a guy called Joe Nenya. Joe ran uh basically global banking for HSBC. And one of the things he used to always do is every year when the graduates came in uh to the company, he would sit down with them and give them problems to solve that he was working on specifically just to see how they would go about doing it, you know.

And you can imagine in a a very hierarchical company like HSBC when you've got some of the most senior leaders sitting down with the most you know junior uh if you will noviceses uh it creates this greatcultural artifact in the company and you know that's again a really powerful way I feel to to shift or set the tone if you will about um what you're looking for.

Well what about you Jana? Tell us for. Well what about you Jana? Tell us tell us some of the things that struck you as you were doing this.

>> So the bit I had to unlearn was I felt like in early in my career and and now many of the customers I work with are almost forced or forcing themselves to try and turn the massive uncertainty the complexity of ripple effects where you can't anticipate you do something over here and something impacts over there or new technology coming up.

We all try to turn uncertainty and and and complexity into fake certainty. We have to know the answers. We have to give a plan. We have answers. We have to give a plan. We have to have a road map. We have to report statuses. And I had to really unlearn statuses. And I had to really unlearn that.

And we had a a brilliant that. And we had a a brilliant conversation with Annie Duke. For for those who don't know them, she's the most successful female poker player in the world, $4 million richer, also a PhD in decision sciences. and she talked to us about um why don't you just um show in your answers in your decisions that you maybe are 70% sure you might not be 100% sure it doesn't have to be a yes or no or you give a range um so this idea of um we don't have to be certain and it's also there's so much more around that first of all is it even okay to say I don't know having the psychological safety to say to say I'm not sure as a leader and then having the curiosity to keep asking questions.

Benedto Vinyas, the CEO of Ferrari, is such a curious mind. He's constantly he's I think he mind. He's constantly he's I think he signed in his first months 300 NDAs to go out and ask lots of customers and partners and others lots of 300 he said right I think so 300 um to ask lots of questions as he designed the strategy and um what they also do really well is what I had to unlearn is shifting mental models. you're stuck in some mental models. you're stuck in some mental model of how you have to behave as a leader that decisions have to go up the hierarchy.

So shifting the mental models hierarchy. So shifting the mental models of um this is not how I have to think and and to me that's the biggest change people can make.

Changing artifacts in an organization like the orcs charts or say we now have leadership principles that's an easy thing most people turn to because it feels like something tangible.

But what has much more impact tangible. But what has much more impact is actually changing this abstract thing, this mental model, how people come to work, how they think, how they make decisions, and how they operate.

And then linked to all of that is creating clarity all the time.

And we've worked with this, we've spoken to this incredible man um um Benedict Burn. He is a um he was a CEO of a sports company, but he also is an extreme mountaineer. So he he climbs Death Zone mountaineer. So he he climbs Death Zone mountains.

And when we interviewed him, mountains. And when we interviewed him, he was in his car on his way to a Taliban area to go somewhere to climb some mountain in Pakistan.

How did you do? >>

And he said, and I said, "Do you think you're going to come back or will this be the last conversation with mankind you'll have?" And so you'll have?" And so >> he told us a super cool story that um most mountaineers when they climb Death Stone Mountains, they take about 50 kilos of weight. They take five days and they take a long time and because they have to take oxygen and all this weight they climb for many days but during that time the weather might change it's a long journey it's much more risky and what he does we could not believe it he says I reduce the weight the total weight I take is 7.2 kilos and that includes my clothes and the skis I carry to ski back down so instead of 50 kilos 7.2 into and to achieve that he shaves his eyebrows.

He cuts every piece of ofhis eyebrows. He cuts every piece of of his shoelace that he doesn't need any jacket inside sips and everything gets cut.

So he creates total focus clarity cut. So he creates total focus clarity on what's needed to then make speed and he uses the same idea of clarity drives speed in his business.

That was I think one of the mattest interview stories we've we've had in the book.

>> I think it was the first too, wasn't it?

And and but the other takeaway when we talked to Benedict was I think and this one of the things I had to unlearn as as leaders we often think we need to set priorities as leaders we also need to set unpriorities. You know what aren't set unpriorities. You know what aren't we going to do?

And that's part of what he took back into the workplace was >> he didn't make people shave their eyebrows. >> Well not that we he didn't he didn't say yeah I don't think he did. Wouldn't surprise me. Uh but it was all about it wasn't just talking at the leadership level about what are we going to do. It's it's like shutting down all of those shadow projects, the the zombie projects that never die. Um to make sure everyone's laser focused on what's important to the organization.

And he took personal accountability for communicating that. He didn't shove it communicating that. He didn't shove it off to a change or communications team. He said, "One of my primary jobs as a CEO is to make sure everyone's actually moving in the same direction." So fascinating individual.

Well, they're grow great people, you know, like Annie's Duke's book, Thinking in Beth, I think it was one of my favorite books that I I read probably in the last five, if not 10 years. Just the the idea behind it, especially as anyone doing innovation or entrepreneurial work and and the point that you made about putting a probabilistic number against your decision, that was a huge breakthrough for me personally.

like I I would find myself saying to people, well, you know, I'm 70% confident in this approach, you know. Um, and it it would it always created agency around folks to sort of challenge the idea. Um, you recognizing that you don't have all the information and this is a calculated probabilistic bet that we're making and it just gave me such a great language.

Um, I didn't start shaving off my eyebrows, but I think I might after listening to your Benedict's approach to life.

But again, as you say, this idea I life. But again, as you say, this idea I think is also really powerful. Um, you know, if you're lucky, businesses give clarity about what you are going to do, but not enough don't say what we're not going to do.

And I think that again is a really powerful, you know, it's like when you ever do these exercises of what's in scope and what's out of scope. You know, that ability to say things that are out of scope actually sometimes I feel creates way more agency because as you said it it closes down areas where we're not going to focus on and that just keeps refining, if you will, like the aperture of what what the company is going to focus on.

And again, these are great like little tips that anybody can do. Like it doesn't cost anything to talk about what's in scope and out of scope or how confident you are in a decision or or based on a probability. They're very small changes probability. They're very small changes in behavior, but they can have a huge impact in in how people sort of think about this in their workplace.

So maybe as you then were starting to dig deeper and I know you've interviewed tons of people, you have your own great experiences from your own careers. So what were some of the things maybe you're starting to think as an industry we might need to start thinking about on learning more that maybe struck you Jana as you were not only pulling the book together but just observations you maybe had that were you had higher conviction on um as a result of going through all these interviews and and and the work that you've both done together. for me a key point.

So the book is um the octopuskey point. So the book is um the octopus organization book is set up in a way of uh describing 36 anti patterns and the reason we did that is because again and again in our own work and in speaking to lots of customers we found that organizations go do the same goto kind of habitual answers to solve problems again or do things that are habitual we don't even think about anymore and don't realize how terribly difficult these make life like using jargon like your perfect example of the data enabled whatever synergistic or we all do it.

I use terrible jargon to explain something because I thought it needed to sound like that and then I read Netflix's strategy and I was like they don't use any jargon. Why are we doing silly any jargon. Why are we doing silly things like that? Or why do we hide information in our silos? Because we think it's powerful. Actually, it makes it much harder to develop really great ideas and solutions for customer and think outwards in the organizations, not me hoarding things or why is it so hard to have tough conversations when actually when you do have them, they feel very satisfying and you get to a better answer.

So all these go-to things better answer. So all these go-to things we do, we try to start uncovering them and these are all together really small changes. You can pick one and just get changes. You can pick one and just get started.

I I let big transformations and started. I I let big transformations and there's this superhero thing and they're expensive and you go to the board and they get signed off and they get branded and they sound cool, but in the end they actually cause a lot of pain. um they end up fatiguing people, scaring people, good people who then either leave or spend their time maneuvering through the organization instead of working because they try to survive.

So my biggest learning for the broader industry is start doing small patterns, let them spread instead of constantly talking about scaling. Continuously adapt your about scaling. Continuously adapt your organization and let everyone be part of that. You don't have to force change that. You don't have to force change people. do it with them and get them to people. do it with them and get them to think about how to change and pick an antiattern, pick a second one and then just start doing little things because together um I think was it Vener Swanool who said um light a thousand fires what he's the CIO of a mining company >> yeah chief transformation officer of a South African mining company mining companies aren't exactly renowned for transforming uh transforming full stop but I love that I love that story because a lot of these transformations start at the senior level of the organization all it takes is for one person to leave and it stops Yeah, >> if you got a thousand people transforming, that's a really hard set of fires for that.

>> And continuously like we have AI now, everybody's asking us a how to how do I have to change my organization? The biggest answer for us is start becoming an organization that doesn't change once for AI, agentic AI become adaptive naturally and then this will permeate through your organization from everybody from every seat.

>> Yeah. And it's anytime you hear someone saying, "Well, we're on a transformation journey. We're calling it vision 2030 or journey. We're calling it vision 2030 or or store of the future or retail >> Phoenix project." >> Yeah, exactly. It's just a uh Oh, that's that's not going to work.

>> But it's I just pick up on one thread about this continuous transformation because often we ask audiences, how many of you got have got to the end of a let's say a fiveyear transformation and said, "Oh my god, we're agile. We're on time and on budget >> and it's done. our transformation is now done. >> Yeah. And it's just and invariably gets a laugh because it doesn't happen ever.

And if if anyone can predict the future like this, why didn't they tell us COVID was coming years ago?

So this idea that we can make project plans for transformations and predict the future over 5 years and nothing's going to change. People inherently know it change. People inherently know it doesn't work.

So this idea of lighting a doesn't work. So this idea of lighting a thousand fires being continuously dissatisfied with the status quo what Amazon would call a day one culture that you know even if every single one of your customers comes to you and says everything you do is perfect you know a good company should say that's great but what are we missing what what could be better and if you can do that if you can light a thousand fires if a thousand people make a thousand small changes every week every month that's far more embedded in your organization and sustainable than trying to do a big top- down transformation information.

>> Well, these are just again great stories and lessons uh to inspire people, you know, um having so many of those antiatterns that you've sort of, if you will, cataloged from your own experience and all these fantastic customers that you've spent time with.

You know, I feel like it's going to be again a great tool for people when they're facing specific challenges that they can, you know, use these as, if you will, inspiration launch points to sort of start tackling something or or making um, you know, one of these changes.

So for you, Phil, then was there was there one or two of the patterns maybe that that you feel really stood out to you that maybe as an industry that you would love to see more people um tackle?

>> There's a couple uh one is we call uh the team of leaders or the leadership team which is uh there was some studies done a few years ago that said about 50% of classic transformations fail at step number one.

And step number one is are number one. And step number one is are we actually all aligned around at a leadership team level around what this transformation is?

And we've had transformation is? And we've had experiences with customers where they've been part of the way through a transformation. We've had the each of transformation. We've had the each of the leaders write down what is it? Who's accountable? How do you measure it?

And I I think the the scientific answer to that is n minus two. So number of people in the room minus two is the number of variants you get.

Uh because often what happens is people sit around the table and someone will say we're going to become a digitally enabled organization. Anyone disagree? Sounds sensible.

Everyone leaves the room and invariably someone says, "Well, that's a CIO's job. Nothing to do with me." They don't realize it's a team sport.

Or they each go back to their function and says, "This is what it means for my function." They actually create more issues by having each function focus on what it means for them rather than accepting that most work happens despite your organizational structure.

Uh um and it organizational structure. Uh um and it goes back to what you were saying about psychological safety too.

It starts at a leadership team level. If the leaders aren't prepared, if someone isn't prepared at a leadership team level to just put their hand up and say, "Uh, hey boss, that sounds good, but what do you mean? Who's accountable? What are we mean? Who's accountable? What are we going to stop? How do we know we're making progress?" So, that's one thing making progress?" So, that's one thing that stands out to me because it all starts with leadership. Leadership is changing, but it's more critical than it's ever been.

And then secondly, starting at leadership team level, one of the other questions we ask audiences is, "How many of you hate people and don't understand money?"

What do you mean? They said, "Well, you got a chief finance officer and a chief HR officer." And it's just like, "WhyHR officer." And it's just like, "Why don't Well, that's stupid. You know, I'm a leader."

Okay. How many of you hate a leader." Okay. How many of you hate technology, data, and organizational change management? I don't understand change management? I don't understand it.

Oh, yeah. No, we got CIO for that. it. Oh, yeah. No, we got CIO for that.

So one of the antipatterns particularly in this era of agentic and generative AI is we need much better understanding across the organization of technology not to turn everyone into technologists but just to know which questions to ask CEOs who've experienced generative AI who've written prompts who can credibly say hey I'm really excited about this technology not because I read about it in some report but here's what I learned over the weekend just playing with playing with this tech.

Um the same with data. Most data issues we see aren't data. Most data issues we see aren't technology. It's leaders who uh proclaim technology. It's leaders who uh proclaim they want to be a data enabled organization but then say hey I've been here 20 years I know what the answer is.

So just that basic understanding and even excitement about understanding >> then you call them they need to become technology teenagers. >> Technology teenagers >> that's what we tend to tease them with when we have these exact convers picks up some technology and just does stuff. It just happens. she just knows how to do things.

So we are saying you need to do things. So we are saying you need to become technology teenagers in boardrooms and get curious and start experimenting.

>> That resonates massively uh for me personally. You know, one of the things personally. You know, one of the things I did maybe about six months ago, I've got a mailing list of about 5,000 execs on it and I sent them all out a survey around understanding what AI particularly means for them.

And like the results were kind of uh fascinating to me. You know, like uh 64% of them to me. You know, like uh 64% of them said that they were at the beginner stage.

Um CEOs were most interested in stage. Um CEOs were most interested in about the cost savings associated to AI.

VPs and directors obviously who had to do most of the work were more worried about how they could save time so they could do all this extra work that they were apparently meant to be saving.

But one one of the things that really really struck me the most was when I asked them how they wanted to learn this technology.

And the bit that was most technology. And the bit that was most fascinating is that almost at an even split it was literally almost 40 40% each.

They either wanted to learn each. They either wanted to learn one-on-one or in very small groups with similar peers.

And a lot of that comes similar peers. And a lot of that comes from a little bit of fear because it's a new thing and you know everyone's sort of a little bit afraid to look like as you say the awkward teenager when they're learning this for the first time as the head of these technology organizations and it it's been really inspiring now.

So, a lot of them I've started coaching these cohorts of these execs now as well. And it's amazing to see when you well. And it's amazing to see when you just give them one or two small little starter steps, these just run with it because they're super bright, competent people, but there's an inertia or fear about the unknown and an overwhelmedness of the amount of tools that are really in front of them.

So, it it's great to hear that you're out there encouraging uh these folks to sort of tackle this and try it because again, what I keep seeing is once they have a little bit of dedication and focus and start trying, they go up the curve in the flash because they're super bright people, you know, uh but you suck in the beginning and that's sort of like, you know, it's sort of this a little bit of a thing to break through.

So, looking forward thenbreak through. So, looking forward then for yourselves, obviously the book is now uh will be out in people's hands. the Octopus Organization. I really encourage everybody go out there, grab yourself a copy. Great thing to read over the holidays and into the new year as you think how you're going to transform your businesses.

Um, so what are you uh both most excited about maybe, you know, as the book goes live? You know, what do you want people to start doing differently? And maybe Phil, you can kick this one off as a reading the book. like what what do you hope the book. like what what do you hope happens when someone finishes the last page and then closes the book and walks into the office on Monday?

>> I hope before they even get to the last page, they just start doing uh they start experimenting. uh many of the start experimenting. uh many of the suggestions in the book are things you can try in a week or a month or so rather than try and read the book end to end and say right we need to do all of this stuff let's put a plan together it's try in a team you know start some of the tips we've had from people like Amy Edmonson the the mother of psychological safety about how do you really build psychological safety in a team try it with your team don't think about scaling to Jana's point earlier on this is about starting these little fires and seeing things spread because people get excited.

So, um just start on the journey and then we'd love to hear what's working, what isn't working, what have other people learned, um as they've experimented because I think we've only scratched the surface of what you could really do here. We know there's so so many other ideas in leaders heads, in individuals heads about going um transforming their organization over time to be something more resilient, more flexible, more agile.

Yeah, I hope people grab just one or two anti patterns. When we when we share anti patterns. When we when we share some of the anti patterns, you see people either chuckle or go ah or people's shoulders look suddenly really heavy. So, you get a really quick heavy. So, you get a really quick physical sense of whether they know exactly what we're talking about.

And I hope that people are c have the courage to grab one of those and run with it. And I'm also I'd love to hear others.

Since we finished the book, we found more and we even we couldn't even fit all the antipatterence. There's some others that we haven't written up that we'll probably publish later. There's some other independence. There will be some that we maybe haven't seen and people might share them with us and say, "Oh, yeah, that's actually that's actually a good one."

So, I'm hoping that people will start doing something, but not always adding on.

The counterintuitive thing I've learned lately is when you try and change, you think you have to introduce something new. But actually, the coolest changes new. But actually, the coolest changes I've seen is removing something, depreciate something, get rid of something, um, deviate from a process or from a tool or a thing and see what happens.

So, I'm hoping that it's a new happens. So, I'm hoping that it's a new and a what first feels counterintuitive, but later comes maybe like a natural thing.

Spread something. Think about thing. Spread something. Think about patterns, not projects and plans.

So take all this what feels counterintuitive in the book right now and and just have some courage to run with it. It's small. Nothing super bad with it. It's small. Nothing super bad can happen if you just start like that small.

>> Wouldn't that be a cool performance review conversation? So Barry, tell me review conversation? So Barry, tell me what have you done this year? Let me tell you what I haven't done and why I've stopped.

>> You know, I I I love that idea too as well. I remember one of the first timeswell. I remember one of the first times I ever did an innovation program very early in my career. I got to go spend some time with them in UC Berkeley where there was sort of an innovation group there. And one of the first things that there. And one of the first things that they said was exactly what you said was most innovations happen when you take things away rather than when you add them. and they gave tons of examples of them. and they gave tons of examples of these things like whether it's an Uber and they took away the idea of even paying people taking your card out and all these amazing things and I just think it's a great um idea you know where we're so focused on adding and sometimes and there's a little bit of an inspiration for learn to as well there's a a sort of famous sort of story of a a you know a monk sitting there and he's pouring more and more stuff into the cup and the cup fills up. The idea is, well, why don't you know, instead of pouring more in, why don't you take some out? And I just love these sort of uh inspirations. Look, um it's been amazing inspirations. Look, um it's been amazing to have you both on the show. I I really thank you for sharing both your own stories, the stories of the people you've talked to, capturing them in this fantastic book, uh The Octopus Organization, a guide to thriving in a world of continuous transformation. Um it's been great to have you on the show. It's been great to follow your journey even as you've been writing this book and you know I look forward to you know many more people enjoying the fruits of all the effort that you've put into this.

So thanks very much again for this. So thanks very much again for being on the show.

>> Thank you Barry.

>> Thank you for having us and for inspiring us as well to put a lot of unlearning in there. Thank you.
