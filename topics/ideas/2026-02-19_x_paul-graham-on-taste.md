# Paul Graham on taste

## TL;DR
- Taste starts with caring enough to question your own preferences.
- The move is from **"I like what I like"** to **"Is this actually good?"**.
- Honest self-critique is a practical skill, not just a personality trait.

## Highlights
> “A lot of having taste about something is just caring about it enough to be honest with yourself, so that you can get past ‘I like what I like’ to ‘Is this actually good?’”
