# Agentic RAG gets a research-backed demo (Self-RAG, Corrective/Adaptive/Tabular RAG + multi-agent)

## TL;DR
A Latent Space / AI News blurb points to a Hugging Face Spaces demo that pitches **Agentic RAG** as *decision-aware* and *self-correcting*—grounding an agent not just in documents, but also **structured/tabular data**, borrowing from a cluster of “RAG variants” research (Self-RAG, Corrective RAG, Adaptive RAG, Tabular RAG) plus **multi-agent orchestration**.

## Takeaways
- The emphasis is shifting from “retrieve more docs” to **make better decisions about retrieval + correction**.
- Agentic RAG is framed as a way to reduce the **“re-explaining tax”** (carry context/memory forward so you don’t start from zero each run).
- Interesting cross-community convergence: persistent memory patterns keep popping up; Latent Space reportedly even mentions **OpenClaw** as a reference implementation for this style of system.

## What’s claimed in the blurb
- A builder demoed an Agentic RAG system “grounded in”:
  - **Self-RAG**
  - **Corrective RAG**
  - **Adaptive RAG**
  - **Tabular RAG**
  - plus **multi-agent orchestration**
- Shared a **live demo** and **full code**.
