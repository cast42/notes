## TL;DR

The tweet frames “success” as multiplicative: you don’t just need skill — you need **leverage**, **positioning**, and a slice of **luck**. The point is to invest beyond pure capability-building.

## The formula

**Success = skill (up to level) × leverage × positioning × luck**

## Notes / interpretation (agentic-coding lens)

- **Skill (up to a threshold)**: once you’re competent enough, additional skill improvements may have diminishing returns versus the other terms.
- **Leverage**: pick workflows/tools that multiply your output.
  - In software right now, this includes strong AI tooling, automation, reusable skills/scripts, and productized artifacts.
- **Positioning**: work in the right domain, with the right distribution channel, and the right problems.
  - For agentic coding: this can mean choosing projects where iteration loops are tight (tests), and outcomes are easy to validate.
- **Luck**: you can’t control it directly, but you can increase surface area (more “shots on goal”).

### Luck as a lifestyle (Dan Koe)
A useful reframe: “luck” can be treated as an *operating mode*:

- High energy
- In the right place
- Around the right people
- Producing more than consuming
- Avoiding any and all distractions
- Able to manage multiple interests
- High agency and self-educated
- Doesn't quit after one mistake
