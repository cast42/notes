# Curate People (Naval) — recruiting and teams

## TL;DR
Naval frames recruiting as *the* founder-critical function: early teams should be small, extremely high-talent, taste-driven, and directly curated by the founder.
The “best only want to work with the best,” so one mediocre hire can drag down the whole talent gradient.

## Takeaways
- **Recruiting can’t be outsourced** (especially early): the founder’s selectivity becomes the company’s DNA.
- **The best only want to work with the best**: being surrounded by weaker peers becomes a cognitive tax.
- **You can’t hire meaningfully “above” the founder** for long (early-stage), because early on “all you’re bringing is you.”
- **Break rules to get top people**: top talent won’t fit cookie-cutter HR processes.
- **Small teams win**: scale is the enemy during 0→1; avoid communication overhead and “culture sludge.”
- **Taste matters**: great people have taste in other great people.
