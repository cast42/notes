# The 10,000 hour lie that keeps talented people broke

I want to tell you about two people I know.

The first guy is one of the most skilled video editors I've ever met. Seriously talented. He can do things in Premiere Pro that shouldn't be possible. He's been editing for like eight years, probably has his 10,000 hours by now, and his work is genuinely beautiful.

He makes around $4,000 a month. Sometimes less.

The second guy is, honestly, a pretty average editor. Good enough, nothing special. He learned the basics maybe two years ago. Couldn't do half the technical stuff the first guy can do.

He made over $30,000 last month.

The difference? The second guy built a system. He has a small team. He positioned himself as the guy who handles content for founders. He doesn't sell editing. He sells "I'll make you look good online and you don't have to think about it."

The first guy sells hours. The second guy sells outcomes.

I used to think skill was everything. Get really good at something and the money will follow. That's what everyone says, right? Put in the work, master your craft, become undeniable.

Turns out that's mostly a lie. Or at least a massive oversimplification that's keeping a lot of talented people broke.

## The 10,000 hour myth

You've probably heard about the 10,000 hour rule. Malcolm Gladwell popularized it in his book Outliers. The idea is that it takes roughly 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to achieve mastery in any field. He pointed to the Beatles, Bill Gates, various chess grandmasters.

It's a compelling idea. It's democratic in a way. It says talent is overrated, hard work is what matters, anyone can become great if they just put in the time.

The problem is it's not really true. Or at least, it's not the whole truth.

First, the actual research Gladwell based this on, by a psychologist named Anders Ericsson, was way more nuanced than "10,000 hours = mastery." Ericsson himself complained that Gladwell oversimplified his findings. The type of practice matters enormously. Deliberate practice with feedback is different from just doing something repeatedly. Most people who spend 10,000 hours on something aren't actually practicing deliberately. They're just repeating what they already know.

But here's the bigger issue, the one that actually affects your life:

Even if you do achieve mastery, mastery alone doesn't guarantee success. Not even close.

The world is full of masterful people who are broke, frustrated, and wondering why their excellence isn't being rewarded. Incredible musicians playing for tips. Brilliant writers who can't pay rent. Skilled craftspeople competing on price with people half as good.

Meanwhile, there are people with a fraction of that skill making ten times the money. Not because they're better. Because they understand something about how value actually flows.

## The leverage question nobody asks

Naval Ravikant has this concept that rewired how I think about work. He talks about the difference between inputs and outputs.

Most people think about work in terms of inputs. How many hours did I put in? How hard did I try? How much did I improve my skills?

But the market doesn't pay for inputs. It pays for outputs. Specifically, it pays for outputs that people value.

And here's the thing. The relationship between skill and valuable output is not linear. It's not like twice the skill equals twice the value. Sometimes a 10% improvement in skill creates 0% more value. Sometimes a person with "worse" skills creates way more value because they're pointed at the right problem.

This is where leverage comes in.

Leverage is what makes the gap between input and output non-linear. It's what allows one person's hour to be worth $20 and another person's hour to be worth $20,000. It's the multiplier that most people ignore while they're busy grinding on skills.

Naval breaks leverage into three types:

Labor. Other people working for you. This is the oldest form of leverage. It's how empires were built. But it's also the hardest to manage. People are complicated.

Capital. Money working for you. Investments, assets, things that generate returns while you sleep. Powerful but you need money to start, which creates a chicken-and-egg problem.

Products with no marginal cost of replication. Code and media, basically. Software you write once and sell forever. Content you create once and distribute infinitely. This is the new leverage, and it's the most accessible.

The skilled video editor I mentioned earlier? Zero leverage. He trades hours for dollars. Every dollar he earns requires him to be there, doing the work.

The average editor with the $30k month? Multiple forms of leverage. He has a team (labor). He has systems that let him take on more clients than he could personally handle. He's building a brand that compounds over time (media).

Same basic skill. Completely different game.

## Why we romanticize mastery

If leverage matters more than skill past a certain point, why do we all obsess over skill development?

I think there's a few reasons.

First, mastery is romantic. There's something beautiful about the image of the craftsman dedicating their life to perfecting their art. We love stories about obsessive dedication. The 10,000 hour rule fits this narrative perfectly. It says greatness comes from devotion, not shortcuts.

And look, there's truth in that. Mastery is meaningful. Being really good at something feels good. There's a depth of experience that only comes from years of focused practice.

But meaning and money are different things. You can have a meaningful practice that doesn't pay. Or you can have a well-paying position that feels meaningless. The romanticization of mastery sometimes blinds us to the practical reality that skill alone isn't enough.

Second, skill development feels like progress. You can measure it. You can see yourself getting better. It's satisfying in a way that building leverage often isn't.

Building leverage is messier. It involves talking to people, which is uncomfortable. It involves putting yourself out there, which is scary. It involves building systems, which is confusing. It involves thinking strategically about positioning, which feels weird and maybe a little gross if you just want to do good work.

So people retreat to what's comfortable. They keep sharpening the saw because sharpening the saw feels productive, even if they're not cutting anything.

Third, and this is the uncomfortable one, focusing on skill is a way of avoiding the real game.

If you tell yourself that success comes from mastery, and mastery takes 10,000 hours, then you have a built-in excuse for why you're not successful yet. You just need more time. More practice. More skill.

It lets you avoid the scarier questions. Like: am I solving a problem people care about? Am I visible to the right people? Am I capturing value or just creating it? Have I built any leverage at all?

Those questions are threatening because you can't answer them by working harder in isolation. You have to engage with the world. You have to do things that might not work. You have to be judged.

Grinding on skills in private is safe. Building leverage in public is not.

## The "good enough" threshold

Here's something I've noticed that contradicts everything I was taught about skill.

For most things, there's a "good enough" threshold. Once you cross it, additional skill has diminishing returns. Sometimes zero returns. Sometimes even negative returns because you're spending time on skill that could go toward leverage.

Let me give you an example.

I do content writing. When I started, I was bad. Like, noticeably bad. My writing was clunky, my ideas were unoriginal, my hooks didn't work.

I got better. A lot better. But here's the thing. The improvement from "bad" to "good enough" mattered a lot. The improvement from "good enough" to "excellent" mattered way less.

Once my writing crossed a certain threshold, clients couldn't really tell the difference. What they could tell was whether I understood their audience, whether I delivered on time, whether I was easy to work with, whether my content actually got results.

Those things had nothing to do with my skill as a writer. They had to do with positioning, reliability, and understanding the business context.

I know writers who are better than me. More elegant prose, more sophisticated ideas. Some of them make less money than I do. Not because the market is unfair (though it is) but because they're optimizing for the wrong variable.

Past the threshold, more skill doesn't help. More leverage does.

## The leverage ladder

Okay so practically, what does this mean? How do you actually build leverage instead of just grinding on skills forever?

I'm still figuring this out myself. But here's how I think about it.

First rung: Get good enough. You do need some baseline skill. You can't leverage nothing. The 10,000 hour rule isn't completely wrong, it's just incomplete. Get to the threshold where you can deliver real value. For most things, this is way less than 10,000 hours. Maybe a few hundred hours of focused practice. Maybe less if you're strategic about what you learn.

Second rung: Solve a specific problem for specific people. This is where most skilled people never go. They stay general. "I'm a designer." "I'm a developer." "I'm a writer." That's not a position, that's a category. Positioning means narrowing down until you're the obvious choice for someone. "I design landing pages for SaaS startups." "I write Twitter threads for founders." The more specific, the more leverage you have in that niche.

Third rung: Productize yourself. This is a Naval concept. Take whatever you do and turn it into something more like a product. Fixed scope, fixed price, clear deliverable. Instead of selling your time, sell an outcome. Instead of "I'll edit your videos for $50/hour," it's "I'll create 30 days of content for $3,000." The second one scales differently.

Fourth rung: Build systems that work without you. This is where real leverage kicks in. Can you document your process? Can you hire someone to do parts of it? Can you create templates, workflows, assets that multiply your output without multiplying your hours? The goal is to make yourself less necessary to the delivery, not more.

Fifth rung: Create assets that compound. This is the endgame. Content that builds an audience over time. Products that sell while you sleep. Equity in something that grows. These are the things that separate people who are well-paid from people who are wealthy.

Most people spend their whole lives on the first rung, convinced that getting better at their skill is the path forward. It's not. It's one small part of the path.

## The uncomfortable math

Let me show you some numbers that kind of messed with my head when I first worked them out.

Let's say you're a freelancer billing $50/hour. You're good. You work hard. You can maybe bill 30 hours a week if you're hustling.

That's $1,500/week. $6,000/month. $72,000/year.

Not bad. But here's the ceiling: there are only so many hours. Even if you raise your rate to $100/hour, which takes years of skill development, you're at $144,000/year max. And you're exhausted because you're working constantly.

Now let's say instead of maximizing your rate, you spend some of that time building leverage.

You create a course teaching what you know. It takes 100 hours to make. You sell it for $200. If 500 people buy it over the next few years, that's $100,000 from 100 hours of work. $1,000/hour effective rate.

Or you build a small agency. You find two people who can do 80% of what you do for 50% of the cost. Now you can take on more clients, deliver through your team, and make money on the spread. Your income is no longer capped by your personal hours.

Or you build an audience by sharing what you learn. That audience becomes leverage for everything else you do. Speaking opportunities, partnerships, inbound clients, higher rates. Hard to quantify but very real.

The math on leverage is just different. It's non-linear in a way that skill improvement isn't.

I'm not saying skill doesn't matter. It does. But past a certain point, an hour spent building leverage is worth way more than an hour spent building skill.

## What I got wrong

I should be honest about my own mistakes here.

When I dropped out of college in 2023 to focus on my business, I thought the path was pretty simple. Get really good at what I do, and success will follow.

So I spent a lot of time on skill. Learning, practicing, improving. And it helped. I got better. I got clients.

But I hit a ceiling pretty fast. I was trading time for money, just like everyone else. Yeah I was better than I was before, but I was still stuck in the same game.

The shift happened when I started thinking about leverage. How could I serve more people without working more hours? How could I capture more of the value I was creating? How could I build something that compounds?

I'm still early in this. I don't have it all figured out. But just asking those questions changed what I focused on.

Less time perfecting my craft in isolation. More time on positioning, systems, audience, partnerships. The stuff that actually multiplies output.

It felt weird at first. Like I was cheating somehow. Like "real" success should come from pure skill.

But that's the 10,000 hour myth talking. The idea that mastery is the path. It's not. Mastery is part of the path. Leverage is the rest.

## The mastery trap

Here's the real danger of the 10,000 hour narrative.

It keeps you focused inward when you should be focused outward. It keeps you in the lab when you should be in the market. It keeps you perfecting when you should be shipping.

There's a version of mastery that becomes a hiding place. An endless project of self-improvement that conveniently never requires you to face the world and risk rejection.

I can always get better. There's always another level of skill to reach. And as long as I'm focused on that, I don't have to ask the harder questions about whether anyone cares, whether I'm capturing value, whether I'm building something that lasts.

The 10,000 hour rule gives permission to stay in that loop forever. It says greatness takes time. So take more time. Keep practicing. You're not ready yet.

Meanwhile, people with half your skill but twice your leverage are running laps around you.

## The balance

I want to be careful here because I don't want to overcorrect.

Skill matters. Being good at something is satisfying in a way that pure leverage-chasing isn't. There's a depth of experience that only comes from years of practice. Mastery has value beyond money.

And some fields really do reward mastery directly. If you want to be a surgeon, a professional athlete, a concert pianist, then yeah, 10,000 hours is probably the path. Those are fields where the top performers are dramatically better than everyone else and that difference gets rewarded.

But most fields aren't like that. Most fields have a good-enough threshold beyond which other factors matter more. Positioning. Visibility. Leverage. Relationships.

The lie isn't that mastery is worthless. The lie is that mastery is enough. It's not.

The full equation looks more like:

Success = Skill (up to threshold) × Leverage × Positioning × Luck

You need enough skill. But past the threshold, the other variables matter more. And most people ignore them completely while grinding on the one variable that's already good enough.

I don't know how to end this cleanly.

I guess I just want you to ask yourself some questions.

Are you past the skill threshold for what you're trying to do? If not, keep building skill. If yes, maybe stop.

Where's your leverage? If you disappeared tomorrow, would any of your work keep generating value? Or does everything require you to show up?

Are you optimizing for being good or for being valuable? They're not the same thing. Sometimes they overlap. Often they don't.

The 10,000 hour rule is comforting because it's simple. Put in the hours, get the results. But the world doesn't work that way.

The people winning aren't always the most skilled. They're the ones who figured out leverage.

That was a hard pill for me to swallow. Maybe it is for you too.

But I'd rather know the real game than keep playing the wrong one.
