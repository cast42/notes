## TL;DR

Goals define **direction + what to say no to**; systems create the **daily actions** that make progress inevitable. Use:
- **SMART** to write goals well
- **HABIT** to design the system
- **OODA** as the feedback loop to adjust both

## The tweet (verbatim)

> "Goals are for vision and filtration.
>
> Systems are for habits and action."

> I always love a good @dankoe tweet.
>
> In fact, I liked this one so much, I decided to dissect it.
>
> I think it’s very important for you all to understand… this is how you achieve massive success in life and work.
>
> But how do you create and balance both?
>
> It’s simple, but hard at the same time.
>
> Here’s the easiest way to do it (that I’ve found).
>
> 1. Use the SMART framework for goals:
>
> Specific: Define the goal clearly
> Measurable: Set criteria to track progress
> Achievable: Ensure the goal is realistic
> Relevant: Align the goal with the mission
> Time-bound: Establish a deadline for the goal
>
> SMART Breakdown: @rajeshshuklnia
>
> 2. Use the HABIT framework for systems:
>
> Habit: Develop a routine behavior
> Actionable: Make the behavior easy to do
> Beneficial: Provide a reward for the behavior
> Iterative: Review and improve the behavior
> Trackable: Record and monitor the behavior
>
> Habit Loop Framework: @bestselfco @cduhigg @nireyal
>
> 3. Use the OODA loop for feedback (to measure if it’s working):
>
> Observe: Gather information about the situation. Progress, challenges, feedback, and results
>
> Orient: Analyze and interpret the information. Identify any gaps between your goals/systems and the reality.
>
> Decide: Choose a course of action. Adjusting your goals or systems, or creating new ones.
>
> Act: Execute the action and observe the results. Observe the outcomes.
>
> Remember:
>
> Goals and systems are complementary and interdependent.
>
> You need both to succeed.

## Coaching lens (how I’d apply this)

### 1) Goals = vision + filtration

- Good goals help you decide what *not* to do.
- If you can’t use the goal to say “no” to something, it’s not filtering.

### 2) Systems = habits + action

- A system is a repeatable set of behaviors that makes the goal more likely.
- The system should be **actionable** at the level of “what do I do today?”

### 3) OODA = learning loop

Treat your goal+system as a hypothesis:
- **Observe**: What happened this week?
- **Orient**: What does it mean? Where’s the gap?
- **Decide**: What’s the smallest adjustment?
- **Act**: Run it and re-observe.
