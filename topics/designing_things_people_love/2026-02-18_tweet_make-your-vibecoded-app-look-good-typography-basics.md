# Make your vibecoded app look good — typography basics

*celine nguyen — @mynameisceline*

## TL;DR

- Good-looking apps are mostly: typography + spacing + restraint.
- Use a type scale + consistent vertical rhythm; stop eyeballing.
- Choose one strong text face, limit weights, and let whitespace do the work.
- Bringhurst is the deep reference: hierarchy, measure, leading, alignment, and color of text.

## Highlights

- Tweet: "…could simply be replaced by this"
- Design mantra: fewer fonts, clearer hierarchy, more whitespace.
- App UI translation: type scale (sizes), line-height, max line length, consistent margins.
- Use typographic contrast (size/weight) instead of decorative UI chrome.
