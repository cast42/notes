# 5 product design lessons from Jony Ive (via Aidan Quigley)

## TL;DR
Aidan Quigley summarizes five recurring lessons associated with Jony Ive’s approach at Apple: prototype relentlessly, surround yourself with intimidatingly good people, obsess over details, draw inspiration outside your work, and say “no” to maintain focus.

## Takeaways (the 5 lessons)

1) **Prototype, prototype, prototype**
- Make lots of small variations to get closer to “right”.
- The point is to *test reality* (does it work? does it feel right?).

2) **People: surround yourself with those who impress/intimidate you**
- Being around exceptional colleagues pushes your taste and skill.
- “You’re a reflection of the five people you spend the most time with” applies at work too.

3) **Sweat the small details**
- Example cited: design choices like being able to lift a MacBook lid with one finger.
- The “fiddle factor” matters (e.g., satisfying AirPods case click).

4) **Draw inspiration from other parts of your life**
- Bring material/taste references from your passions into your work.
- Example cited: high-end materials (e.g., aluminum) influenced by interest in cars.

5) **Learn to say no (focus)**
- Saying “no” is how you avoid mediocrity-by-sprawl.
- Example cited: Apple reducing many product lines down to a focused set of segments.
