# Steve Jobs: the real breakthrough people are thinker-doers (Leonardo as exemplar)

## TL;DR
Jobs argues that the people who change an industry are not “idea people” vs “doers” — they are **both**. He uses **Leonardo da Vinci** as the archetype: artist *and* chemist/engineer in the details.

## Post (verbatim)
> Steve Jobs on why the greatest breakthroughs come from people who both think and do: "The doers are the major thinkers. The people that really create the things that change this industry are both the thinker-doer in one person." He uses Leonardo da Vinci as the perfect example: "Did Leonardo have a guy off to the side that was thinking five years out in the future what he would paint or the technology he would use to paint it? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints. He also was a fairly good chemist." Jobs explains that it was this combination of art and science, thinking and doing, that produced Leonardo's exceptional results. And he sees no difference in the technology industry. He also calls out a common pattern: People who claim credit for ideas without doing the hard work of execution. "It's very easy for somebody to say, 'Oh, I thought of this three years ago.' But usually when you dig a little deeper, you find that the people that really did it were also the people that really worked through the hard intellectual problems as well." The takeaway? Ideas alone aren't enough. The people who make real contributions are the ones willing to get deep into the details of execution, and it's through that execution that the hardest intellectual problems actually get solved.
