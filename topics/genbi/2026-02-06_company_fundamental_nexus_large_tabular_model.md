# Fundamental (NEXUS Large Tabular Model)

## TL;DR
Fundamental positions **NEXUS** as a “**Large Tabular Model (LTM)**”: a foundation-model-like approach for **tabular/structured enterprise data**.
The pitch: text has LLMs, images have vision models — **tables now have tabular models** — enabling better prediction and decision support from the data that actually drives enterprises.

## Takeaways
- This is “GenBI” in the sense of **generative/AI-native analytics over tables**, but it reads more like a **model layer** than a classic BI dashboard product.
- If they can generalize across messy enterprise tables, it could become a new primitive for:
  - forecasting
  - anomaly detection
  - decision support
  - feature engineering / pattern discovery

## What they claim (public)
From their LinkedIn company page:
- “Built by **DeepMind alumni**”
- “Trusted by **Fortune 100 enterprises**”
- HQ: San Francisco, CA · Founded 2024 · ~51–200 employees (LinkedIn)

## Context from the investor/partner post
Laurens De Poorter (Syndicate One) highlights:
- Fundamental “emerged from stealth” with **$255M funding** (per the post)
- Frames NEXUS as a foundation model for structured data (“tabular intelligence”)
