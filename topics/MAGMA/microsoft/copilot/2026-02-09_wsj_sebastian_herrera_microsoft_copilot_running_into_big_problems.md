# WSJ: Microsoft’s pivotal AI product (Copilot) is running into big problems

## TL;DR
The WSJ reports that **Copilot is central to Microsoft’s AI strategy**, but is struggling with **confusing positioning**, **inconsistent experiences across “Copilots”**, and **weak adoption/engagement** relative to competitors—raising the risk that enterprise buyers conclude “AI isn’t delivering” because their default tool is underwhelming.

## What stood out
- **Copilot is “the” wedge** for Microsoft’s AI-first strategy (Nadella-level priority), especially as the OpenAI partnership dynamics shift.

- **Adoption vs footprint gap**
  - Microsoft reported **15M M365 Copilot seats sold** vs **450M+ paid M365 seats**.
  - Analysts (Citi) cited some customers using only ~**10%** of the seats they pay for.

- **Preference drift to alternatives (survey data)**
  - Recon Analytics survey (150k+ US respondents) suggests the % of Copilot subscribers using it as their primary option **fell** (reported: **18.8% → 11.5%** from Jul→late Jan), while **Gemini** rose (**12.8% → 15.7%**).
  - Users cite **quality**, **UX**, and **restrictive limits**.

- **Product/UX confusion**
  - Multiple Copilots (M365/enterprise, developer/IT, consumer) create a fragmented mental model.
  - Interoperability gaps are called out—even internally (Nadella email anecdote).

- **Org/infra constraints**
  - Silos between consumer and enterprise orgs reportedly complicate a unified product vision.
  - Internal model-building efforts constrained by **compute capacity**; proprietary model benchmarks trailing competitors.

- **Microsoft internal push**
  - Heavy internal adoption drive: managers asked to discuss AI use; employees quantify usage.
  - Microsoft spending hard to make Copilot a visible consumer brand (ads, Super Bowl spot).

## Coaching / strategy angle
- **Bundling ≠ adoption**: “seats sold” is a lagging and potentially misleading indicator.
- The enterprise risk pattern: if the default tool is weak, leadership may **generalize** that “AI doesn’t work.”
- The real unlock is often **workflow integration + interoperability + data readiness**, not adding a chatbot UI.
