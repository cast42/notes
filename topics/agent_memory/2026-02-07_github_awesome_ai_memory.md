# Awesome AI Memory (curated repo)

## TL;DR
A curated, frequently updated “awesome list” focused specifically on **AI memory for LLMs and agents** — spanning long-term memory, reasoning, retrieval, memory-native system design, benchmarks, and engineering frameworks.

## Takeaways
- Useful as a **radar** for the fast-moving subfield of agent memory.
- The repo collects both:
  - research papers (often with short bullet summaries)
  - benchmarks/evals and system design patterns
- Good starting point when you want to answer: “what’s the current best idea for *episodic memory*, *memory reconsolidation*, *compression/forgetting*, *multi-agent memory*, *traceable memory*, etc.?”

## What’s inside (high-level)
From the repo description:
- long-term memory for LLMs/agents
- reasoning + retrieval
- memory-native system design
- evaluation benchmarks
- real applications / engineering practice
