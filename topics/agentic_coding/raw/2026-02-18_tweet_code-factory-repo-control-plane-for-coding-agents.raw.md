This post is essentially a link-post to the attached X Article.

Article title: Code Factory: How to setup your repo so your agent can auto write and review 100% of your code
Article preview:
The goal
You want one loop:
1) The coding agent writes code
2) The repo enforces risk-aware checks before merge
3) A code review agent validates the PR
4) Evidence (tests + browser + review) is machine-verifiable
5) Findings turn into repeatable harness cases
