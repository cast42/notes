# AI and the Next Economy (Tom O'Reilly)

## TL;DR
Tom O’Reilly argues that “build AGI → GDP explodes” stories ignore the core constraint of any economy: **circulation** (production matched to demand via purchasing power).
For an “AGI company” to matter economically, it won’t be enough to build models—it must invent a **platform/flywheel** that enables others to create value and get paid.

## Takeaways
- An economy is not just production; it’s **production + demand** + the mechanisms that connect them.
- AI can accelerate discovery, but **diffusion** (productization, regulation, manufacturing, distribution, training, maintenance) determines whether society benefits broadly.
- The strategic prize is creating a **circulatory AI economy**: a flywheel where users/suppliers/customers all become more capable and more prosperous.
- O’Reilly points to earlier platform winners (Google/Amazon) that solved *circulation*, not just capability.
- Decentralized architectures create value; centralized ones capture it. Premature centralization can stall innovation.

## Details

### The platform/flywheel lens (your framing)
Your main point (worth keeping in view): companies “building AGI” also need to invent a **platform** that lets users become profitable—analogous to how:
- Google connected suppliers of goods/services with advertisers and buyers, raising conversion through better market design (Hal Varian et al.).
- Meta built social networks and monetized attention/identity for advertisers.

A provocative framing from your note:
> “AGI stands for Advertisement Generated Income.”

And a strategic speculation:
- The next “AGI company” could try to combine **Google’s network** with **Meta’s identities** into one company.

### What O’Reilly emphasizes in the article
- **Capability is not GDP**: discovery needs a long pipeline to become economic value.
- **Labor replacement** risks demand collapse if wages fall fast.
- Winners in prior eras built complements and infrastructure that expanded markets.
- AI labs should measure success by **diffusion**, not just model capability.
- Build for interoperability/portability; don’t enshittify from the beginning.
